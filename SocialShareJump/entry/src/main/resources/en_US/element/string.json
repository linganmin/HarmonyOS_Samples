In addition, the multi-device experience continuity needs to be maintained, the multi-device independent design needs to be improved, and the workload and maintenance costs of developers need to be reduced as much as possible. HarmonyOS provides a multi-device-oriented design guide, allowing designers to use a scientific method to minimize the design workload and ensure design consistency. In addition, HarmonyOS provides corresponding technical capabilities to help developers quickly design multi-device applications."
